Efficacy of Proxalutamide in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, ParallelDesign Clinical Trial

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has claimed 2.6 million lives globally since it first emerged in December of 2019.1 SARS-CoV-2 infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung and endothelial cells by anchoring to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Prior to binding to ACE2, spike proteins on the viral surface undergo structural modification via endogenous transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2).2 Because of this modification, Hoffman, et al. proposed that inhibitors of TMPRSS2 would limit SARSCoV-2 infection.2 The TMPRSS2 promoter includes a 15 base pair androgen response element.3 This led our group to hypothesize that antiandrogen drugs would be good candidates for limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells.4 While the mechanism of action of antiandrogens against SARS-CoV-2 is not fully elucidated, pre-clinical studies have shown that nonsteroidal antiandrogens down regulate TMPRSS25 and inhibit viral replication in human cell culture.6,7 Proxalutamide is a second-generation nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist that is more potent than other antiandrogen compounds such as enzalutamide or bicalutamide.8 These compounds competitively inhibit androgen binding, block androgen receptor nuclear translocation, and prevent their binding to DNA.9 We previously studied the use of proxalutamide, in SARS-CoV-2 positive men in an outpatient setting. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, men treated with proxalutamide (200 mg/day) demonstrated significantly reduced hospitalization rates, accelerated improvements of COVID-19 symptoms, and accelerated viral clearance.10 Proxalutamide also reduced the duration of COVID-19 in both men and women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the outpatient setting.11 Here, we evaluated the efficacy of proxalutamide compared to the usual care in hospitalized men and women with COVID19.

Methods
Trial Design, Setting and Locations
This was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, two-arm trial. The trial was conducted at eight centers in six cities of the state of Amazonas, Brazil from February 1 to April 15, 2021, including enrollment and follow-up.
Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria: Men and women hospitalized due to COVID-19 with a previously confirmed positive test for SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days prior to randomization. SARS-CoV-2 status was determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) testing following the Cobas SARS-CoV-2 rtPCR kit test protocol (Roche, USA).
Exclusion criteria included mechanical ventilation at the time of randomization, a history of congestive heart failure class III or IV (New York Heart Association), immunosuppression, alanine transferase (ALT) above five times ULN (> 250 U/L), creatinine above 2.5 mg/ml, or a calculated eGFR was below 30 ml min. Patients currently using any antiandrogen medications were also excluded. In female patients, those that were pregnant, breastfeeding, or were planning to become pregnant within 90 days were also excluded. Patients were randomized to receive either proxalutamide 300 mg/day plus usual care or a placebo plus usual care for 14 days in a 1:1 ratio. If patients were discharged before 14 days, they were instructed to continue treatment. Therapy compliance was monitored daily.

Procedures

The COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale was used for screening (day 0) as well as daily clinical assessments of patients on days 1-14 (or inpatient after day 14), as well as day 21, and day 28 (if outpatient), resulting in a maximum of 17 data points for each patient. The clinical score is defined as: 8. Death; 7. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation; 6. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 5. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygenrequiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities; and 1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.12 Participants discharged from the hospital were evaluated by investigators in followup appointments whenever possible, or by daily phone calls. Upon hospital discharge, patients were instructed to contact the same hospital and the local study team in case of relapse or new symptoms. Hospital readmissions were actively surveilled in all sites. Baseline characteristics, previous medical history, and concomitant medications were recorded for each patient. Proxalutamide 300 mg/day or placebo plus usual care was given for 14 days, even when COVID-19 remission occurred before this period. Usual care included medications such as enoxaparin, colchicine, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, or antibiotic therapy if necessary. Before the onset of the trial, a random sequence was created using a web-based randomization software13 using 4, 6 and 8 block sizes and a list length for 662 treatments. The randomization sequence and the allocation concealment were performed remotely from the patient recruiting centers and it was not stratified by site. Pre-packing of tablets of either active or placebo group was manufactured to appear identical (Kintor Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Suzhou, China). The procedure is detailed in the Supplementary Appendix. The local investigators who were directly involved with patient care, other healthcare providers, and patients were kept blinded to the group assignments until all patients completed the 28-day post-randomization period and the data was locked. The principal investigator was unblinded for data and safety analysis in March 2021. The interim analysis was conducted on March 10th 2021, when the primary outcome measure was reported for a total of 590 patients.

Outcomes and Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome measure was the 8-point COVD-19 ordinal scale at postrandomization day 14. The primary efficacy endpoint measure was the overall recovery ratio, which was calculated from recovery rates in each group. Recovery was defined as achieving alive hospital discharge (scores 1 and 2). The secondary outcome measures included recovery rate and all-cause mortality rate (score 8) and respective risk ratios at post-randomization day 28; all-cause mortality hazard ratio; median hospitalization time; and median post-randomization time to recover (alive hospital discharge). Subgroup analysis included sex and baseline scores. An intention-to-treat protocol was used for data analysis. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to assess the differences of the ordinal scale scores at 14 and 28 days. Risk ratios were calculated to measure the effects of proxalutamide versus placebo on the recovery and all-cause mortality rates.
Additional analysis included the recovery and mortality risk ratios by gender, baseline COVID-19 ordinal score, and hospital site. To evaluate the all-cause mortality and recovery over the 28-days post-randomization observation period, we used Kaplan-Meier’s survivor function for estimates of proportion surviving and failure function for estimates of alive hospital discharges. Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality over 28 days and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Graphical assessment and Kaplan-Meier versus predicted survival showed that of the proportional hazards assumption has not been violated, Figure S3. The sample size was calculated to be able to detect a difference of approximately 14% in the overall recovery rate at 14 days (risk ratio of 1.36) with a power of 90% and a type I error of 5%, over an estimated 39% recovery rate for the placebo group (based on the protocol for NCT04280705 [scenario 4]), and 3.5% non-compliance/cross over for each group. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05 and no correction for multiple comparisons was performed. Stata/SE version 16.1 for Mac (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA) was used to perform all statistical analysis.

Results
Patients
Between February 1 and March 17, 2021, 697 patients were assessed for eligibility, including 396 males (56.8%) and 301 females (43.2%). At screening, twelve patients did not meet the eligibility criteria as they had kidney failure or liver abnormal enzymes (1.7%) and forty patients declined enrollment (5.7%). Of the 697 patients initially assessed, 645 underwent randomization. Three hundred seventeen patients were randomized to receive proxalutamide in addition to usual care, including 184 males (58.0%) and 133 females (42.0%). Three hundred twenty-eight were assigned to receive placebo in addition to usual care, including 182 males (55.5%) and 146 females (44.5%). After randomization, 29 of the 317 (9.1%) patients receiving proxalutamide and 36 of the 328 (10.9%) receiving placebo did not complete the trial protocol, the reasons are described in Figure 1. The baseline characteristics of the study populations are described in Table 1. The median age was 50 years (interquartile range [IQR], 41 to 62) and 49 years (IQR, 38 to 61) for the proxalutamide and placebo groups, respectively. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) above 30kg/m2, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) were equally distributed between study arms. No comorbidities, one comorbidity, and two or more comorbidities were present in 69.4%, 17.3%, and 13.3% of participants, respectively, and were equally distributed between study arms. Median time from hospitalization to randomization was 2 days (IQR 1 to 4.2) for placebo and 2 days (IQR 1 to 4) for proxalutamide. The ordinal scale scores at baseline were 6, 5, and 4 in 66.5%, 30.4%, and 2.8% of the population, respectively. The distribution of ordinal scale score was similar between proxalutamide and placebo arms. Except for colchicine, all concomitant medications were used at similar proportions between the groups. Remdesivir was not a treatment option (emergency use authorization dated March 12, 2021 in Brazil).14 Compliance with the 14day treatment was 91% and 89% for the proxalutamide and placebo arms, respectively. Of note, since the study was conducted in Brazil, the population is ethnically mixed and the majority of patients did not identify themselves as Caucasian, black, or Asian.

Primary Outcome
At the 14-day timepoint, a lower score distribution was observed for the proxalutamide group than in the placebo group, Figure 2A. The median score in the proxalutamide group was 1 (IQR 1 to 2) versus 7 (IQR 2 to 8) for placebo (P<0.001), Table 2. The overall 14-day recovery rate for placebo of 35.7% (95% CI 30.7 to 40.1) was lower than for proxalutamide (81.4%; 95% CI 76.7 to 85.3), P<0.001. The 14-day recovery ratio was 2.28 (95% CI 1.95 to 2.66 [P<0.001]), which indicates patients who took proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo (95% CI 95 to 166%). No interaction effect of the primary outcome and gender was observed, Table 2 and Figure 2B.

Secondary Outcomes
At the 28-day timepoint, a lower score distribution was observed for the proxalutamide group than in the placebo group, Figure 2A. The median ordinal scale score was 1 (IQR 1–1) for proxalutamide versus 7 (IQR 2 to 8) for placebo. No difference was observed between sexes upon stratification for both placebo and proxalutamide at 28 days, Figure 2B. The overall 28-day recovery ratio was 1.81 (95% CI 1.60 to 2.00), which indicates that patients who took proxalutamide had an 81% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo (95% CI 60 to 100), Table 2. A high risk of all-cause mortality was observed for placebo (49.4%; 95% CI 44.0 to 54.7) compared to proxalutamide (11.0%; 95% CI 8.0 to 14.9). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one death from COVID-19 in hospitalized patients over 28 days was 3 (95% CI 3 to 2). The risk ratio for death was 0.22 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.31), which indicates that treatment with proxalutamide reduced all-cause mortality rate over 28 days by 77.7%. Subgroup analysis by gender showed no interaction effects in any of the secondary outcome measures, Table 2. Other subgroup analyses of the 28-day recovery ratio and all-cause mortality risk by city of the study site are present in Tables S3 and S4 of the Supplementary Appendix. Figure 3 depicts the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and alive hospital discharge within 28 days for both the proxalutamide and placebo treated groups overall. The difference in the proportion surviving was evident as early as day 3 and increased over the remaining study period, which includes days after the 14-day therapy period (Figure 3A). This demonstrates there was no noticeable rebound effect if therapy was completed. The difference in the proportion of alive hospital discharge was statistically significant at day 2, and increased until day 11, reaching 75%, Figure 3B. Patients in the proxalutamide group during the study period were 84% (95% CI 89-76%) less likely to die than patients in the control group (hazard ratio for death 0.16 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.24]). The median hospitalization time (days) was lower in the proxalutamide arm (8, IQR 6-13) compared to the placebo (12, IQR 8-18).

Safety Outcomes
Adverse events observed during the course of the trial are detailed in Table 3. Adverse events grade 4 or 3 were more commonly observed in the placebo arm (40.9%) than in the proxalutamide arm (2.2%), P<0.001. Diarrhea was the only adverse event reported at higher proportions in those receiving proxalutamide (16.1%) versus those receiving placebo (3.3%), P=0.005. Irritability was reported in four patients treated with proxalutamide (1.3%) and none in the placebo group. Among males taking proxalutamide, four reported spontaneous erection (2.2%) versus none in males taking placebo.

Discussion
Here we demonstrate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that the use of proxalutamide, a second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen, reduced mortality, length of stay, and significantly improved clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings are consistent with our reports of the efficacy of proxalutamide in an outpatient setting,10,15 as well as reports using other antiandrogen regimens, including dutasteride and finasteride.16,17 Proxalutamide was a benefit to COVID-19 patients who were severely ill. At the time of the trial, the state of Amazonas experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases resulting in overcrowding at hospitals. As such, prioritized admission to hospitals resulted in admission of the most severely affected patients with COVID-19. Additionally, we found the mortality rate to be exceptionally high (49.4%) in the placebo group. Though the observed mortality rate may have been influenced by the emergent P.1 strain, the high mortality rate we observed in the placebo group is not unexpected based on past reports.18,19 The northern Amazonas region of Brazil have reported high mortality rates, ranging from 24-55% amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients as early as April of 2020, while the average rates observed in all of Brazil range from 14-38%.18,19 As of March, 2021, the P.1 lineage is responsible for at least 70% of the current SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in Brazil, and for at least 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the state of Amazonas.20 In a post-hoc analysis, sequencing of viral genomes from patient samples obtained from the study sites and during the trial dates were found to be the P.1 lineage in all but one case (Supplementary Appendix, Table S5). P.1 is considered one of most relevant variants of concern (VOC) worldwide. This variant has demonstrated enhanced affinity for ACE-2 binding, potentially resulting in higher viral loads.21 In particular, the E484K substitution, previously demonstrated by our group as
being positively selected in diverse lineages in Brazil,22 can induce immune escape with consequent reinfection and failure of other therapeutic modalities, such as convalescent plasma.23 It is encouraging to note, therefore, that proxalutamide was effective in a region with high P.1 prevalence.
Finding new or repurposed drugs active against VOCs and other SARS-CoV-2 harboring mutations is of paramount importance. Multiple agents have been explored in clinical trials as treatments for COVID-19. To date, the most promising of these treatments are remdesivir,24 a viral RNA-polymerase inhibitor, remdesivir plus the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, baricitinib,25 and dexamethasone,26 a glucocorticoid without mineralocorticoid effect. Remdesivir has been reported to reduce the median time to recovery of hospitalized COVID-19 patients to 10 days, down from 15 days observed with placebo.24 The mortality rate of patients treated with remdesivir was 11.4% at 29 days compared to 15.2% in the placebo group, though not reaching statistical significance (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03).24 Similarly, the combination of remdesivir and baricitinib trended to a reduction in 28-day mortality from 7.8% to 5.1% (HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.09).25 It is difficult to compare results across trials, but we observed the clinical benefits of proxalutamide to be superior to either of these treatments with greater than 77.7% reduction in 28-day mortality rate under ITT analysis (HR of 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.24). Direct comparisons among therapies are warranted to delineate effective regimen(s). Dexamethasone has also been demonstrated to benefit the most severe COVID-19 patients; among those patients requiring mechanical ventilation, dexamethasone was shown to reduce mortality compared to placebo (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81).26 All of the participants in this trial received corticosteroids, but there was still a survival advantage to receiving proxalutamide. Treatment emergent adverse events associated with proxalutamide were limited to diarrhea. Diarrhea was also reported to be more frequent among the proxalutamide group in an outpatient trial.11 In contrast, severe adverse events of renal failure and hepatic damage were associated with placebo, Table 3. We interpret this finding as the natural progression of COVID-19 in the placebo group, which further supports consideration of proxalutamide as a therapy for hospitalized patients. While Phase 1 safety data for proxalutamide supports its use for 28 days in both men and women (Protocol for details), it has been studied primarily in prostate cancer patients, therefore, long term side effects should be assessed in future studies. Alternatively, other approved molecules of the same class may show similar results, such as apalutamide, enzalutamide, darolutamide, bicalutamide, or flutamide. Important limitations are present in this study. First, the remote locations of many of the study sites created operational difficulties that led to an unbalanced distribution of proxalutamide and placebo amongst sites (details provided in Supplementary Appendix). Minor differences in effects of proxalutamide between sites may have resulted from factors such as local infrastructure and age distribution (Figures S5 and S6). However, the possibility of effect sizes skewing in favor of the proxalutamide group due to its disproportional concentration in the smaller hospitals is unlikely because a similar size effect was observed in subgroup analysis of all hospital sites (Tables S3 and S4). Second, the severity of patients admitted to Amazonas hospitals during the trial did not allow us to test proxalutamide in many hospitalized patients who did not require supplemental oxygen (ordinal score 3). However, we have previously shown that proxalutamide reduced hospitalizations and improved symptom recovery and viral clearance in outpatients with mild-moderate disease.10 Moreover, the subgroup analysis showed patients with baseline scores of 3-5 benefited from proxalutamide. Third, more patients used colchicine in the placebo arm despite randomization.

This most likely reflects additional therapeutic interventions associated with longer hospitalization in the placebo group. Colchicine is unlikely, however, to have contributed to increased mortality directly as there is either no effect,27 with 28-day mortality rate ratio of 1.01 in the RECOVERY platform trial (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.10)28, or limited benefit in COVID-19.29–31 Forth, remdesivir was not available to our patients. Despite the lack of a direct acting antiviral, however, patients receiving proxalutamide had a substantial benefit. Lastly, a dropout rate of approximately 9-11% was observed in both study arms. The explanation for this participant attrition varied and was seen in both arms, nevertheless, proxalutamide retained its efficacy in the ITT analysis. This trial has generated important questions requiring further study. Despite being an antiandrogen therapy, women treated with proxalutamide responded similarly to proxalutamide-treated men (Fig 2 and Table 2).

Additionally, the significant improvement observed in severely-ill patients appeared disproportionate to the proposed mechanism of reducing viral entry (Table 2, Baseline score 6). These findings suggest additional mechanism(s) of action beyond androgen antagonism and TMPRSS2 knockdown that will require additional investigation. Because of the logistical difficulties executing this trial and the high mortality in Brazil during the study period, our findings must be evaluated in other populations. It is urgent that additional trials examine nonsteroidal antiandrogens in different settings.

Conclusions
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving treatment with proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo at day 14. All-cause mortality was reduced by 77.7% over 28 days. Further studies of proxalutamide and other antiandrogen therapies in COVID-19 patients in different settings and locations are urgently needed.

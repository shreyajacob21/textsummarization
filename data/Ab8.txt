Integrating synthetic biology into wearables could expand opportunities for noninvasive monitoring of physiological status, dis- ease states and exposure to pathogens or toxins. However, the operation of synthetic circuits generally requires the presence of living, engineered bacteria, which has limited their application in wearables. Here we report lightweight, flexible substrates and textiles functionalized with freeze-dried, cell-free synthetic circuits, including CRISPR-based tools, that detect metabolites, chemicals and pathogen nucleic acid signatures. The wearable devices are activated upon rehydration from aqueous exposure events and report the presence of specific molecular targets by colorimetric changes or via an optical fiber network that detects fluorescent and luminescent outputs. The detection limits for nucleic acids rival current laboratory methods such as quantita- tive PCR. We demonstrate the development of a face mask with a lyophilized CRISPR sensor for wearable, noninvasive detec- tion of SARS-CoV-2 at room temperature within 90 min, requiring no user intervention other than the press of a button.

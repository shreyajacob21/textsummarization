1e), a toehold switch for the detection of Ebola virus RNA (Fig. The toehold sensor enabled detection of Ebola virus RNA at a concentration of 300 nM at 30 min compared with a control sample containing no target (unpaired t-test of independent reaction chambers; deconvoluted green channel P = 0.0074) (Fig. For DNA detection, we used a Cas12a ortholog from Lachnospiraceae bacterium (LbaCas12a)19,21 that displays a nonspecific collateral cleavage activity towards single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) after detection of a gRNA-defined double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) target. From activation of the face-mask sensor to a final readout only takes ~1.5 h. The limit of detection observed for our sensors is 500 copies (17 aM) of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA, which matches that of World Health Organization-endorsed standard laboratory-based RT–PCR assays40 (Fig. Under these realistic simulation conditions, the face-mask sensor was able to detect a contrived SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (vRNA) fragment after a breath sample collection period of 30 min, with a calculated accumulation of 106–107 vRNA copies on the sample pad, as determined by qPCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) (Fig. We believe our SARS-CoV-2 mask could combine protection and sensing into one system and could be adapted to discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, as well as different emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants46,47.

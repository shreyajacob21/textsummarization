Tocilizumab for COVID-19

INTRODUCTION

The majority of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are either asymptomatic or result in only mild disease.1 However, a substantial proportion of infected individuals develop a respiratory illness requiring hospital care, which can progress to critical illness with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring prolonged ventilatory support. Hypoxic respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 is associated with evidence of systemic inflammation, including release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and TNFα, and elevated levels of D-dimers, ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP).3,4 The host immune response is thought to play a key role in driving an acute inflammatory pneumonic process with diffuse alveolar damage, myeloid cell infiltrates, and microvascular thrombosis.5 The beneficial effects of dexamethasone and other corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients with hypoxic lung damage suggest that other, more specific immunomodulatory agents may provide additional improvements in clinical outcomes.6,7 Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanised anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody that inhibits the binding of IL-6 to both membrane and soluble IL-6 receptors, blocking IL-6 signalling and reducing inflammation. Randomised trials of tocilizumab in COVID-19 have so far shown mixed results for 28-day mortality: six small trials reported no benefit while the somewhat larger REMAP-CAP trial reported a benefit in patients requiring organ support.8-14 Here we report the results of a large randomised controlled trial of tocilizumab in adult patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 characterised by hypoxia and significant inflammation. METHODS

Study design and participants

The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is an investigator-initiated, individually randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial to evaluate the effects of potential treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. At randomisation, 562 (14%) patients were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, 1686 (41%) were receiving non-invasive respiratory support (including high-flow nasal oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure, and non-invasive ventilation), and 1868 (45%) were receiving no respiratory support other than simple oxygen therapy (9 of these patients were reportedly not receiving oxygen at randomisation) (table 1). In pre-specified subsidiary analyses, we found no significant effect of tocilizumab on subsequent receipt of non-invasive respiratory support or invasive mechanical ventilation among those on no respiratory support at randomisation (table 2, webfigure 1). These benefits were consistent across all patient groups studied, including those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive respiratory support, or no respiratory support other than simple oxygen. These include six small trials (fewer than 100 deaths in each) and the somewhat larger REMAP-CAP trial, which recruited critically ill patients with COVID-19, over 99% of whom required non-invasive respiratory support or invasive mechanical ventilation.8-14 Taken together, these previous trials did not show a significant mortality benefit for treatment with tocilizumab (death rate ratio 0·91, 95% CI 0·72-1·14, figure 4). These benefits are in addition to those previously reported for corticosteroids, which is now usual standard of care for COVID-19 patients requiring treatment with oxygen.6,18 Our data suggest that in COVID-19 patients who are hypoxic and have evidence of systematic inflammation, treatment with a combination of a systemic corticosteroid plus tocilizumab would be expected to reduce mortality by about one-third for patients receiving simple oxygen and nearly one-half for those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. For example the US National Institutes for Health conclusion is that there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of tocilizumab or sarilumab, a view shared by some commentators.19,20 By contrast, interim guidance in the NHS states that IL-6 antagonists should be considered for patients within 24 hours of starting non-invasive respiratory support or invasive mechanical ventilation.21 Our results show that the benefits of tocilizumab extend to a broader group of patients receiving oxygen with or without other forms of respiratory support, and that those benefits include a reduction in the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and other organ support such as renal replacement therapy. Since complicating bacterial infections are infrequent in the early hospitalisation period of COVID-19, this recognised concern in relation to the use of tocilizumab would be lessened with earlier use.22 Based upon the ISARIC4C database, approximately 49% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the UK would meet our inclusion criteria and hence would benefit from tocilizumab (personal communication, ISARIC4C Investigators).

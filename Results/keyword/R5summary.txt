Seroconversion rates following COVID-19 vaccination among patients with cancer

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 can result in increased morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer (Kuderer et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2020; Bakouny et al., 2020), suggesting the need for prophylactic strategies in this immunosuppressed population. Follow-up studies on seroconversion in cancer patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that while most will develop antibody response similar to the general population, subgroups of cancer patients with hematologic malignancies, receiving anti-CD20 antibody therapies and stem cell transplantation, exhibit lower rates of seroconversion (Thakkar et al., 2021; Marra et al., 2020). However, trials of the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines in general excluded patients with a diagnosis of a malignancy, therefore information on the safety and efficacy of these vaccines regarding the development of effective immunity currently is extremely sparse (Friese et al., 2021). Given the higher morbidity and mortality of patients with cancer and COVID-19, their ongoing need to be exposed to the healthcare system, and their frequent need for immunosuppressive therapies, patients with cancer have been identified as a high-priority subgroup for COVID-19 vaccinations, an effort supported by multiple key organizations (Ribas et al., 2021; Van Der Veldt et al., 2021; Desai et al., 2021). For example, following certain immunosuppressive therapies, such as an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, anti-CD20 therapies, or T cell-directed regimens, vaccinations have low efficacy and their best timing is unclear (Jaffe et al., 2006; Rubin et al., 2014). While many agencies have suggested administering vaccines 1–2 weeks prior to a chemotherapy dose, this recommendation has not been practical with limited vaccination slot availability, variable chemotherapy (e.g., weekly), and vaccine administration schedules (e.g., two doses of BNT162b2 are recommended to be given 21 days apart while two doses of mRNA-1273 are given 28 days apart), leading to liberal recommendations to allow the most rapid vaccination of these immunosuppressed patients (Desai et al., 2021). To narrow this key knowledge gap, we conducted this study to comprehensively determine the immunogenicity of vaccines in a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of a malignancy in New York City via evaluation of rates of anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody positivity following vaccination with one of the three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved COVID-19 vaccines. Finally, 233 patients with cancer having completed the FDA-recommended two doses of the mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 [Polack et al., 2020] or mRNA1273 [Baden et al., 2020]) or one dose of the adenoviral vaccine (AD26.COV2.S [Sadoff et al., 2021]) were included in the safety analysis (Figure 1). Twenty-six de-identified patients without a cancer diagnosis who had completed COVID-19 vaccination and received a SARS-CoV-2 IgG spike antibody test >7 days after their most recent vaccine dose were used as a control cohort (Table S1). One hundred and fifteen patients (54%) had completed vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine and 62 (31%) with the mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine, while 20 (10%) had received the single dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Highest IgG titers were seen with the mRNA-1273 vaccine (median 11,963 AU/mL, standard deviation [SD] 18,742), followed by the BNT162b2 vaccine (median 5,173 AU/mL, SD 16,699) and the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (median 1,121 AU/mL, SD 17,571) (p < 0.05, Kruskall-Wallis test, Figure 2B). Recognizing that the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was introduced late onto the market, which might or might not account for the lower titers of spike antibodies, we assessed associations of antibody seropositivity and antibody titers with time from completion of vaccination. We then conducted a multivariate analysis with a generalized linear model and observed that the relationship between vaccine type and titers remained significant after accounting for the effect of time from vaccine (Figure S1). We observed significantly lower seroconversion rates in patients who underwent these therapies: stem cell transplant (73%, p = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test), antiCD20 therapies (70%, p = 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test) and CAR-T cell treatments (all three patients remained seronegative after vaccination, p = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 3). We also noted trends toward lower titers among other subgroups, such as patients having received BCL2-or BTK-targeted therapy, consistent with prior observations on their negative impact on vaccine efficacy (Pleyer et al., 2021) (Figure S3). Association with prior COVID-19
Previous studies have reported heightened antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccinations in patients with a prior COVID-19 infection (Krammer et al., 2021). Lower seropositivity rates have also been observed in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and myeloma (Herishanu et al., 2021; Terpos et al.,2021; Bird et al., 2021) and in those undergoing therapy with BTK inhibitors or venetoclax/anti-CD20 therapy, in line with our observations (Herishanu et al., 2021). These early studies clearly highlight the need to complete full vaccination schedules for optimum seroconversion and also emphasize the need for larger cohort studies to determine the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines among patients receiving distinct cancer therapeutics. Another potential limitation is underestimation of titer values for anti-spike antibodies, as evidence suggests that titers may rise over time, and the upper limit of detection of our assay is 50,000 AU/mL (Widge et al., 2020); however, a cutoff of 7 days was used to match the control cohort and eliminate bias in the analysis. In addition, higher doses or booster doses of some vaccines or vaccinations of mixed vaccine types might offer stronger immunogenicity and need to be explored in immunosuppressed patients.

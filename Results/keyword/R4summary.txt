Efficacy of Proxalutamide in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, ParallelDesign Clinical Trial

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has claimed 2.6 million lives globally since it first emerged in December of 2019.1 SARS-CoV-2 infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung and endothelial cells by anchoring to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. proposed that inhibitors of TMPRSS2 would limit SARSCoV-2 infection.2 The TMPRSS2 promoter includes a 15 base pair androgen response element.3 This led our group to hypothesize that antiandrogen drugs would be good candidates for limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells.4 While the mechanism of action of antiandrogens against SARS-CoV-2 is not fully elucidated, pre-clinical studies have shown that nonsteroidal antiandrogens down regulate TMPRSS25 and inhibit viral replication in human cell culture.6,7 Proxalutamide is a second-generation nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist that is more potent than other antiandrogen compounds such as enzalutamide or bicalutamide.8 These compounds competitively inhibit androgen binding, block androgen receptor nuclear translocation, and prevent their binding to DNA.9 We previously studied the use of proxalutamide, in SARS-CoV-2 positive men in an outpatient setting. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, men treated with proxalutamide (200 mg/day) demonstrated significantly reduced hospitalization rates, accelerated improvements of COVID-19 symptoms, and accelerated viral clearance.10 Proxalutamide also reduced the duration of COVID-19 in both men and women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the outpatient setting.11 Here, we evaluated the efficacy of proxalutamide compared to the usual care in hospitalized men and women with COVID19. Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria: Men and women hospitalized due to COVID-19 with a previously confirmed positive test for SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days prior to randomization. The median score in the proxalutamide group was 1 (IQR 1 to 2) versus 7 (IQR 2 to 8) for placebo (P<0.001), Table 2. The overall 14-day recovery rate for placebo of 35.7% (95% CI 30.7 to 40.1) was lower than for proxalutamide (81.4%; 95% CI 76.7 to 85.3), P<0.001. The 14-day recovery ratio was 2.28 (95% CI 1.95 to 2.66 [P<0.001]), which indicates patients who took proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo (95% CI 95 to 166%). The overall 28-day recovery ratio was 1.81 (95% CI 1.60 to 2.00), which indicates that patients who took proxalutamide had an 81% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo (95% CI 60 to 100), Table 2. A high risk of all-cause mortality was observed for placebo (49.4%; 95% CI 44.0 to 54.7) compared to proxalutamide (11.0%; 95% CI 8.0 to 14.9). Patients in the proxalutamide group during the study period were 84% (95% CI 89-76%) less likely to die than patients in the control group (hazard ratio for death 0.16 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.24]). Discussion
Here we demonstrate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that the use of proxalutamide, a second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen, reduced mortality, length of stay, and significantly improved clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Though the observed mortality rate may have been influenced by the emergent P.1 strain, the high mortality rate we observed in the placebo group is not unexpected based on past reports.18,19 The northern Amazonas region of Brazil have reported high mortality rates, ranging from 24-55% amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients as early as April of 2020, while the average rates observed in all of Brazil range from 14-38%.18,19 As of March, 2021, the P.1 lineage is responsible for at least 70% of the current SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in Brazil, and for at least 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the state of Amazonas.20 In a post-hoc analysis, sequencing of viral genomes from patient samples obtained from the study sites and during the trial dates were found to be the P.1 lineage in all but one case (Supplementary Appendix, Table S5). Remdesivir has been reported to reduce the median time to recovery of hospitalized COVID-19 patients to 10 days, down from 15 days observed with placebo.24 The mortality rate of patients treated with remdesivir was 11.4% at 29 days compared to 15.2% in the placebo group, though not reaching statistical significance (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03).24 Similarly, the combination of remdesivir and baricitinib trended to a reduction in 28-day mortality from 7.8% to 5.1% (HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.09).25 It is difficult to compare results across trials, but we observed the clinical benefits of proxalutamide to be superior to either of these treatments with greater than 77.7% reduction in 28-day mortality rate under ITT analysis (HR of 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.24). Dexamethasone has also been demonstrated to benefit the most severe COVID-19 patients; among those patients requiring mechanical ventilation, dexamethasone was shown to reduce mortality compared to placebo (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81).26 All of the participants in this trial received corticosteroids, but there was still a survival advantage to receiving proxalutamide. Colchicine is unlikely, however, to have contributed to increased mortality directly as there is either no effect,27 with 28-day mortality rate ratio of 1.01 in the RECOVERY platform trial (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.10)28, or limited benefit in COVID-19.29â€“31 Forth, remdesivir was not available to our patients.

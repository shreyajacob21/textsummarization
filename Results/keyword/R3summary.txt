Bioinformatic analysis and selection of SARS-CoV-2 target regions
A key aspect of coronavirus replication is nested transcription, which produces high levels of subgenomic RNA from the 3′ end of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome during active infections (34) including the nucleoprotein (N) gene (Fig. The best-performing N gene RPA primers from a set of 100 pairs tested showed exact target matches in 97.4% (forward primer) and 97.0% (reverse primer) of NCBI SARS-CoV-2 genomes. To ensure the universality of the N gene gRNA and RPA primers for SARS-CoV-2 variants, we obtained full-length high-quality sequences [>29,000 nucleotides (nt), <1% Ns, and <0.05% unique amino acid mutations not seen in other genomes] from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) (37) for the B.1.1.7 (50,001 genomes), B.1.351 (577 genomes), and P.1 (78 genomes) variants and aligned as separate groups. This primer SNP is not expected to have any consequential effect on RPA amplification efficiency based on the length of RPA primers and previous studies on RPA primer design, which demonstrate a tolerance of 1- to 3-nt mismatches (38). SHERLOCK assays that specifically identify SARS-CoV-2 variants
To identify the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 variants, we designed SHERLOCK assays that targeted a panel of key spike protein mutations that are currently representative of these variants: N501Y, Y144del, and E484K (Fig. The N501Y gRNA exactly matched 99.8% of B.1.1.7 genomes, 98.8% of B.1.351 genomes, and 100% of P.1 genomes (table S1). The lack of exact matches to the B.1.351 and P.1 genomes is due to a G>A SNP at the genomic position corresponding to the +7 position from the 5′ end of the forward RPA primer in 99.3% of B.1.351 and 100% of P.1 genomes. The E484K mutation is a critical spike RBD mutation present in the B.1.351, B.1.525, and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 variants, which has drawn attention. This mutation has been identified as a potential major contributor to reduced efficacy of current vaccinations and immunity resulting from natural nonvariant SARS-CoV-2 infections with demonstrably lower viral neutralizing potency from convalescent and post-vaccinated patient sera and reduced susceptibility to several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (21, 23, 24). To avoid nucleic acid purification kits that are costly, are labor-intensive, and require specialized equipment and user training, we developed a novel technique to inactivate nucleases in unprocessed saliva, lyse viral particles, and concentrate resultant nucleic acids onto a porous membrane that can be directly added to SHERLOCK detection reactions. Slowing the flow rate to 1.5 min/ml did not increase RNA recovery, but given the sharp drop-off in RNA recovery at flow rates faster than 1 min/ml, we aimed for a total flow time of 3 to 6 min to maximize RNA capture from our 2-ml sample volume, which was achieved by flowing through a 4-mm-diameter PES membrane (figs. In miSHERLOCK, on-device sample preparation and RNA concentration onto a PES membrane are followed by on-device physical transfer of the RNA-containing capture membrane into one-pot SHERLOCK reactions. We tested full-length synthetic RNA representative of the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (Twist B.1.1.7_601443), P.1 (Twist EPI_ISL_792683), and B.1.351 (Twist EPI_ISL_678597) containing N501Y, Y144del, and E484K mutations and spiked them into commercially obtained healthy human saliva. The miSHERLOCK platform worked well across a range of concentrations and also lowered the LOD 2- to 20-fold, as compared to one-pot SHERLOCK assays performed with equivalent concentrations of synthetic full-length SARS-CoV-2 variant RNA spiked in water (fig. Given the successful integration of sample handling, salivary nuclease inactivation, viral RNA extraction, purification, concentration, and one-pot SHERLOCK in the miSHERLOCK device with improved overall signal output, we obtained clinical saliva samples from 27 RT-qPCR–positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (Boca Biolistics) to test the performance of miSHERLOCK with clinical samples. We describe the design of miSHERLOCK as a low-cost, portable, self-contained, and integrated diagnostic capable of highly sensitive universal detection of SARS-CoV-2 that equals CDC RT-qPCR performance guidelines, as well as being the only POC diagnostic capable of specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants. It is also possible that background mutations surrounding clinically important mutation sites may eventually make non–sequencing-based nucleic acid diagnosis of these mutations challenging. However, the number of genomes that show even a few background SNPs adjacent to the clinically relevant mutations mentioned above is extraordinarily small, and we anticipate that CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 mutation characterization will continue to have meaningful utility. Bioinformatic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and gRNA and RPA primer design
For universal SARS-CoV-2 detection, 43,305 full-length sequences were downloaded from NCBI and aligned using MAFFT (49). To produce mutant RNA target sequences, synthetic DNA with an upstream T7 promoter sequence (5′-GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and in vitro transcribed to generate 150- to 500-bp RNA targets for different mutant regions using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit from New England Biolabs (NEB).

Here, we describe the development of a low-cost, self-contained, POC diagnostic called miSHERLOCK (minimally instrumented SHERLOCK) that is capable of concurrent universal detection of SARS-CoV-2 as well as specific detection of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, or P.1 variants. miSHERLOCK combines instrument-free, built-in sample preparation from saliva, room temperature stable reagents, battery-powered incubation, and simple visual and mobile phone–enabled output interpretation with a limit of detection (LOD) that matches U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays for SARS-CoV-2 of 1000 copies (cp)/ml (Fig. The best-performing N gene RPA primers from a set of 100 pairs tested showed exact target matches in 97.4% (forward primer) and 97.0% (reverse primer) of NCBI SARS-CoV-2 genomes. To ensure the universality of the N gene gRNA and RPA primers for SARS-CoV-2 variants, we obtained full-length high-quality sequences [>29,000 nucleotides (nt), <1% Ns, and <0.05% unique amino acid mutations not seen in other genomes] from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) (37) for the B.1.1.7 (50,001 genomes), B.1.351 (577 genomes), and P.1 (78 genomes) variants and aligned as separate groups. SHERLOCK assays that specifically identify SARS-CoV-2 variants
To identify the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 variants, we designed SHERLOCK assays that targeted a panel of key spike protein mutations that are currently representative of these variants: N501Y, Y144del, and E484K (Fig. The N501Y gRNA exactly matched 99.8% of B.1.1.7 genomes, 98.8% of B.1.351 genomes, and 100% of P.1 genomes (table S1). The lack of exact matches to the B.1.351 and P.1 genomes is due to a G>A SNP at the genomic position corresponding to the +7 position from the 5′ end of the forward RPA primer in 99.3% of B.1.351 and 100% of P.1 genomes. The Y144del spike mutation is a 3-nt deletion characteristic of B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variants that is not present in B.1.351 and P.1 variants. Our assay clearly distinguished between wild-type and Y144del target RNA to an LOD of 10,000 cp/ml using full-length synthetic B.1.1.7 variant RNA diluted in water (fig. The E484K gRNA and forward and reverse RPA primers all exactly matched 100% of B.1.351 and P.1 genomes (table S1). The E484K gRNA and RPA primers also exactly matched to nearly 100% of B.1.1.7 genomes, but because B.1.1.7 lacks the G23012A SNP that causes E484K and therefore the TTTN PAM site, our E484K assay will have substantially reduced activation by B.1.1.7 genomes. In miSHERLOCK, on-device sample preparation and RNA concentration onto a PES membrane are followed by on-device physical transfer of the RNA-containing capture membrane into one-pot SHERLOCK reactions. The user pushes a plunger into the column, which punctures a water reservoir to rehydrate and activate the SHERLOCK reaction as well as deposits the PES membrane inside the reaction chamber. The miSHERLOCK platform worked well across a range of concentrations and also lowered the LOD 2- to 20-fold, as compared to one-pot SHERLOCK assays performed with equivalent concentrations of synthetic full-length SARS-CoV-2 variant RNA spiked in water (fig. Given the successful integration of sample handling, salivary nuclease inactivation, viral RNA extraction, purification, concentration, and one-pot SHERLOCK in the miSHERLOCK device with improved overall signal output, we obtained clinical saliva samples from 27 RT-qPCR–positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (Boca Biolistics) to test the performance of miSHERLOCK with clinical samples. However, miSHERLOCK showed highly sensitive and specific detection with commercially sourced full-length variant RNA spiked into control human saliva and showed near-perfect concordance with RT-qPCR when detecting SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples of unprocessed saliva. It is also possible that background mutations surrounding clinically important mutation sites may eventually make non–sequencing-based nucleic acid diagnosis of these mutations challenging. Ten microliters of RPA primer screen reaction were added to a 1.25-μl Cas reaction with the same reaction conditions as described for the gRNA screen. CRISPR-based sensor reactions were prepared using 200 nM EnGen Lba Cas12a (NEB), 400 nM gRNA, 1× NEB buffer 2.1, 430 nM each of the RPA primers (IDT), ProtoScript Reverse Transcriptase (5 U/μl; NEB), RNase H (0.05 U/μl; Ambion), 20 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) (pH 6.8) (Thomas Scientific), 60 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 5% polyethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 μM fluorophore-quenched ssDNA fluorescent reporter (56-FAM/TTATT/3IABkFQ) (IDT), 14 mM magnesium acetate (TwistDx), and 1 TwistAmp Basic RPA pellet (TwistDx). The water reservoir was covered with a piece of foil held in place with double-sided tape and filled with 50 μl of water for reaction rehydration, the lyophilized reactions were placed within the reaction chamber, the transilluminator filter was slotted into place, the cellulose absorbent filter was placed at the bottom of the lysis chamber, and the PES filters were attached to the bottom of the sample preparation column (Fig.

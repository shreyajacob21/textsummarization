The worlds largest trial of COVID-19 drugs has produced more good news: The anti-inflammatory drug tocilizumab cut the death risk of people hospitalized with the disease, reduced their need for a mechanical ventilator, and shortened time spent in the hospital, investigators of the United Kingdoms Recovery trial announced today at a press conference. In the trial, 2022 patients were randomly allocated to receive tocilizumab and compared with 2094 others randomized to receive usual care; 82% of the patients also received dexamethasone. Early COVID-19 trials of tocilizumab had mixed results, but they were smaller than Recovery. And although the REMAP-CAP trial only included the sickest patients, the Recovery results suggest the benefit extends to patients with milder disease as well. Another inhibitor called sarilumab showed a similar effect in the REMAP-CAP trial, but results from two large, completed trials of that drug are yet to be reported. Publication of results from those trials is now essential to assess whether alternative [interleukin-6] antagonists to tocilizumab are effective, the Recovery investigators write in their preprint. The trial is still testing aspirin, an anti-inflammatory drug named colchicine, an antibody cocktail from drug company Regeneron, and baricitinib, another drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.

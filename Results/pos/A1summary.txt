It relies on essentially the same novel mRNA technology as vaccines from the Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration and Moderna, which had more than 90% efficacy in their trials, and it holds some practical transportation and storage advantages over those rival shots. The vaccine’s mRNA was designed for a version of spike that was dominant among viruses early in the pandemic but has evolved through multiple mutations. Other efficacy trials have found that certain mutant strains of the coronavirus can compromise the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to protect against mild disease, but the variant that has most powerfully undermined other vaccines, Beta, was not seen in the CureVac study. Unlike CureVac’s mRNA shot, she says, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines “work very well against Alpha.” She cautions that it’s difficult to compare trials of different vaccines, but says, “It’s just hard for me to believe that the variants could have this degree of effect.”

CureVac did not provide any data about how many of the infected in its efficacy trial developed severe disease. The type of mRNA used by CureVac may undermine antibody formation, contends Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, who helped pioneer certain mRNA modifications used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. CureVac’s vaccine used an unmodified form of mRNA. He notes that a BioNTech study comparing modified and natural mRNA vaccines also found that the modifications boosted the antibody response. Peter Kremsner of University Hospital Tübingen, who helped run the CureVac study, suggests another factor: too low a dose of vaccine. CureVac reported data from a monkey study that compared its current vaccine to a next-generation version, which is more stable inside of cells and made in collaboration with the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline: The new candidate produced higher levels of the spike protein, triggering a 10-fold higher level of neutralizing antibodies. Dose-ranging studies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have also found that higher mRNA doses offer relatively modest gains in antibody levels.

COVID-19 vaccines offer robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with cancer, according to an article published online June 5 in Cancer Cell. Vaccine protection levels are generally better for people with solid cancers than for patients with cancers of the blood, the researchers report, although most people with any cancer made detectable antibodies to the coronavirus after receiving a vaccine. Patients receiving treatments that suppressed the activity of their immune system, such as B celldepleting therapies for leukemia, produced fewer antibodies after receiving a vaccine than did recipients with solid cancer. Almost all of the solid tumor patients (98 percent) produced antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in sufficient abundance to be detected by the antibody test, as did a large majority (85 percent) of people with blood cancer. Among the cohort with blood cancer, patients on B celldepleting therapies were less likely to make detectable antibodies than were blood cancer patients taking other types of treatment. Twenty-two cancer patients in this study had already contracted and recovered from COVID-19 by the time they received a vaccine, and all but one of these individuals made detectable antibodies, generally at significantly higher levels than did the cancer patients who had not contacted COVID-19. Vermas study is, I think, confirming initial reports that patients with hematologic malignancies dont have as much success mounting antibodies as patients with solid cancer or patients without cancer at all. Verma says he thinks this would work better for newly diagnosed blood cancer patients who are not yet receiving any treatment, rather than for patients for whom these B celldepleting therapies are an essential part of their care. In addition to timing vaccination and therapy schedules for certain patients, other strategies for boosting antibody production could be to offer a vaccine booster shot or monoclonal antibodies to some patients.

It would be the best news by far in COVID-19 treatment: According to a preprint published on 22 June, an experimental prostate cancer drug named proxalutamide reduced deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patients by 77% in a clinical trial in Brazil. Matthew Rettig, a prostate cancer oncologist at  UC Los Angeles who is leading a similar trial with another drug, says the oversize impact gives him pause, but If this can be confirmed it would be a home run for sure, he says. The final analysis is in the new preprint, which reports that almost half of patients in the placebo group died, versus only 11% in the treatment arm, a 77% reduction in mortality. But on 8 June, the Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported that the Brazilian National Research Ethics Commission was investigating the study because the authors failed to report trial deaths as quickly as required by clinical trial rules in Brazil, and at different times reported a total of 170 and more than 200 deaths during the trial. And as for the rapid recruitment, Cadegiani says as word got out in hospitals that patients in the proxalutamide trial were recovering within days and being released, others clamored to get into the trial. Because proxalutamide is not yet approved or sold in Brazil, some doctors have begun to treat COVID-19 with other antiandrogens and prostate cancer drugs, such as dutasteride and bicalutamide. A February study in the Journal of Urology, led by prostate cancer researcher Nima Sharifi of the Cleveland Clinic, found that in 1779 men with prostate cancer, androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) had no effect on their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Another study, led by researchers from Vanderbilt University and presented at a recent meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, found ADT treatment in nearly 600 prostate cancer patients had no effect on the number who died from COVID-19.

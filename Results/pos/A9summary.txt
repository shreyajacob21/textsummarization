Researchers find that surges in COVID-19 case numbers are associated with deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in an antigenic site of the spike protein. The team hypothesizes these deletions could assist the virus in evading immunity, potentially playing a role in surges and vaccine breakthrough infections. All 18 surge-associated deletions occurred in the NTD of the spike protein, clustering in sites targeted by neutralizing antibodies. The work lines up with an analysis from earlier this year of nearly 150,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from the GISAID database, which revealed four discrete sites within the NTD that have recurrent deletions in antigenic sites. Virologist Ricardo Soto Rifo of the University of Chile who did not participate in the study says it “highlights the relevance of the NTD” as an important antigenic site for neutralizing antibodies.

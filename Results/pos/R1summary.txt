Study design
This was a dosage escalation study, starting with 2 μg CVnCoV and progressively increased in subsequent groups with dosages of 4, 6, 8, and 12 μg. After assessing safety data for 60 hours, the iSRC and DSMB approved the vaccination of the remaining participants of that dosage group (including placebo subjects and subjects known to be seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, randomized and blinded) and the sentinels of the next higher dosage group. Vaccine
The study vaccine, CVnCoV, is an investigational LNP-formulated RNActive ® SARS-CoV-2 vaccine composed of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, an mRNA that encodes a pre-fusion conformation stabilized version of the full length spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and four lipid components: cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), PEG-ylated lipid and a cationic lipid. Participants then recorded in diary cards solicited local (injection-site pain, redness, swelling, and itching) and systemic (headache, fatigue, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) adverse events and daily temperature using a supplied thermometer for 7 days after each vaccination, and any unsolicited adverse events until the next study visit 28 days after vaccination. A minimum of 12 evaluable participants per dose and per age group was considered adequate for this purpose , but in anticipation of drop-outs and with uncertainty about the proportion which would subsequently be found to have prior asymptomatic exposure to SARS-CoV-2 a conservative number of 48 per group (24 in each age group) was chosen. As this is a dose-escalation study not all safety and immunogenicity are yet available for the later groups (higher doses) in this interim analysis, and safety and immunogenicity data are not presented according to age group or retrospectively confirmed baseline serostatus for SARS-CoV-2. The primary endpoints for the safety objective were the frequencies of SAEs, Grade 3 solicited AEs within 60 hours of vaccination, frequencies and severity of solicited AEs within 7 days of vaccination, and the occurrence, intensities, and causality of unsolicited AEs with 28 days of vaccination. Systemic AEs displayed similar overall rates after the first and second vaccinations, but the severity of these increased for the second dose in the groups receiving the 4 μg to 12 μg dose. In subjects Figure 3 shows the immune response as ELISA IgG antibodies against the S protein with low but variable median titers in the baseline samples (placebo group is not shown as there were no changes in median values over the 50 day period shown). Samples in the 8 μg group from Day 57, four weeks after the second dose, show a small decline in IgG median titers to 1825 (879–2834), but overall these persisted above baseline and the Day 29 (pre-second dose) values. Notably, the value at Day 43 in the 12 μg group was comparable to the median titer of 6381 (5400–12432) in the group of 67 convalescent sera. When IgG antibody titers against S protein RBD were assessed (Figure 4), an evident response in the 8 μg group data (only group with a full data set in this interim analysis) was shown at Day 29 after one dose. There was a further increase by Day 43 when the seroconversion rates were 83% and 91% in the 8 and 12 μg groups with median titers of 1240 (349–2952) and 1007 (678–3141), respectively, which were comparable to the median of 1448 (726–5391) observed in convalescent sera. This response was less obviously dosedependent from the available samples, but across the groups 34–64% had seroconverted at Day 36 (7 days after the second dose) from baseline. In contrast to S protein IgG levels, the 8 μg group median neutralizing titers at Day 43 (56.5 MNT50 [20.0–113]) were generally maintained to Day 57 (56.6 MNT50 [24.8–125]). In this interim report, induction of an adaptive humoral immune response was demonstrated by the increase in neutralizing antibodies, with 56–77% of participants achieving VNT seroconversion two weeks after two doses of 2–8 μg, and 100% seroconverting two weeks after two 12 μg doses. S protein IgG and VNT responses were detectable after the first vaccination, but all markedly increased within 7 days of the second vaccination indicating efficient priming by the first dose. Furthermore, the data show that good memory responses are induced by the natural infection, since even in subjects with low antibody titers at baseline, low doses of CVnCoV (either 2µg or 4µg ) were able to expand antibody titers by more than a factor 10 within one week after the first vaccination. The study is ongoing with additional testing of higher doses (16 μg and 20 μg) to investigate the boundaries of the safety window and completion of the assessments of the present groups, with follow up foreseen until at least 1-year post vaccination. Based on the need to adequately balance an acceptable reactogenicity profile with a strong immune response in the range of convalescent sera (including 100% seroconversion for VNT), the 12 μg dosage has been selected for further investigation in phase 2 and 3 studies, most notably in a phase 2b/3 study to assess efficacy and safety in 36,500 participants that will begin in the coming weeks.

proposed that inhibitors of TMPRSS2 would limit SARSCoV-2 infection.2 The TMPRSS2 promoter includes a 15 base pair androgen response element.3 This led our group to hypothesize that antiandrogen drugs would be good candidates for limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells.4 While the mechanism of action of antiandrogens against SARS-CoV-2 is not fully elucidated, pre-clinical studies have shown that nonsteroidal antiandrogens down regulate TMPRSS25 and inhibit viral replication in human cell culture.6,7 Proxalutamide is a second-generation nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist that is more potent than other antiandrogen compounds such as enzalutamide or bicalutamide.8 These compounds competitively inhibit androgen binding, block androgen receptor nuclear translocation, and prevent their binding to DNA.9 We previously studied the use of proxalutamide, in SARS-CoV-2 positive men in an outpatient setting. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, men treated with proxalutamide (200 mg/day) demonstrated significantly reduced hospitalization rates, accelerated improvements of COVID-19 symptoms, and accelerated viral clearance.10 Proxalutamide also reduced the duration of COVID-19 in both men and women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the outpatient setting.11 Here, we evaluated the efficacy of proxalutamide compared to the usual care in hospitalized men and women with COVID19. Procedures

The COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale was used for screening (day 0) as well as daily clinical assessments of patients on days 1-14 (or inpatient after day 14), as well as day 21, and day 28 (if outpatient), resulting in a maximum of 17 data points for each patient. The local investigators who were directly involved with patient care, other healthcare providers, and patients were kept blinded to the group assignments until all patients completed the 28-day post-randomization period and the data was locked. The secondary outcome measures included recovery rate and all-cause mortality rate (score 8) and respective risk ratios at post-randomization day 28; all-cause mortality hazard ratio; median hospitalization time; and median post-randomization time to recover (alive hospital discharge). The sample size was calculated to be able to detect a difference of approximately 14% in the overall recovery rate at 14 days (risk ratio of 1.36) with a power of 90% and a type I error of 5%, over an estimated 39% recovery rate for the placebo group (based on the protocol for NCT04280705 [scenario 4]), and 3.5% non-compliance/cross over for each group. Median time from hospitalization to randomization was 2 days (IQR 1 to 4.2) for placebo and 2 days (IQR 1 to 4) for proxalutamide. The 14-day recovery ratio was 2.28 (95% CI 1.95 to 2.66 [P<0.001]), which indicates patients who took proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo (95% CI 95 to 166%). Secondary Outcomes
At the 28-day timepoint, a lower score distribution was observed for the proxalutamide group than in the placebo group, Figure 2A. The overall 28-day recovery ratio was 1.81 (95% CI 1.60 to 2.00), which indicates that patients who took proxalutamide had an 81% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo (95% CI 60 to 100), Table 2. The risk ratio for death was 0.22 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.31), which indicates that treatment with proxalutamide reduced all-cause mortality rate over 28 days by 77.7%. Figure 3 depicts the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and alive hospital discharge within 28 days for both the proxalutamide and placebo treated groups overall. Patients in the proxalutamide group during the study period were 84% (95% CI 89-76%) less likely to die than patients in the control group (hazard ratio for death 0.16 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.24]). These findings are consistent with our reports of the efficacy of proxalutamide in an outpatient setting,10,15 as well as reports using other antiandrogen regimens, including dutasteride and finasteride.16,17 Proxalutamide was a benefit to COVID-19 patients who were severely ill. At the time of the trial, the state of Amazonas experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases resulting in overcrowding at hospitals. Though the observed mortality rate may have been influenced by the emergent P.1 strain, the high mortality rate we observed in the placebo group is not unexpected based on past reports.18,19 The northern Amazonas region of Brazil have reported high mortality rates, ranging from 24-55% amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients as early as April of 2020, while the average rates observed in all of Brazil range from 14-38%.18,19 As of March, 2021, the P.1 lineage is responsible for at least 70% of the current SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in Brazil, and for at least 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the state of Amazonas.20 In a post-hoc analysis, sequencing of viral genomes from patient samples obtained from the study sites and during the trial dates were found to be the P.1 lineage in all but one case (Supplementary Appendix, Table S5). Remdesivir has been reported to reduce the median time to recovery of hospitalized COVID-19 patients to 10 days, down from 15 days observed with placebo.24 The mortality rate of patients treated with remdesivir was 11.4% at 29 days compared to 15.2% in the placebo group, though not reaching statistical significance (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03).24 Similarly, the combination of remdesivir and baricitinib trended to a reduction in 28-day mortality from 7.8% to 5.1% (HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.09).25 It is difficult to compare results across trials, but we observed the clinical benefits of proxalutamide to be superior to either of these treatments with greater than 77.7% reduction in 28-day mortality rate under ITT analysis (HR of 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.24). Dexamethasone has also been demonstrated to benefit the most severe COVID-19 patients; among those patients requiring mechanical ventilation, dexamethasone was shown to reduce mortality compared to placebo (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81).26 All of the participants in this trial received corticosteroids, but there was still a survival advantage to receiving proxalutamide. Second, the severity of patients admitted to Amazonas hospitals during the trial did not allow us to test proxalutamide in many hospitalized patients who did not require supplemental oxygen (ordinal score 3). However, we have previously shown that proxalutamide reduced hospitalizations and improved symptom recovery and viral clearance in outpatients with mild-moderate disease.10 Moreover, the subgroup analysis showed patients with baseline scores of 3-5 benefited from proxalutamide. Conclusions
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving treatment with proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo at day 14.

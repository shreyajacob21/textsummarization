A face mask that both protects against respiratory pathogens and tests for SARS-CoV-2 as accurately as a lab test? The idea for a mask came when some physician-scientists on their team who were treating COVID-19 patients mentioned how difficult it was to triage suspected patients when the existing diagnostic tests were so slow. Because people coming in with COVID-19 symptoms were immediately given masks, Nguyen explains, the team thought, Why not integrate a test into the mask? The mask could also be useful for hospital staff, who could wear the mask all day and then run the test at the end of their shift, instead of having to step away from their work to be tested, Nguyen adds. The team created a sensor that senses SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the users breath and that the researchers say can be integrated into any mask (in their study, they use a KN95). To activate the mask, the user simply presses a button to release a tiny amount of water into the masks self-contained sensing system to rehydrate the components of a three-step reaction. The released indicator reacts with a strip in the mask, changing the pattern of lines on the strip (which can be oriented on the inside of the mask, for the users privacy)much like a pregnancy test.
